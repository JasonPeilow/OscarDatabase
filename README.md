There is a lot of controversy surrounding the Oscars. 

This is widely publicised, so the next task I have is referencing some of the articles below. In my opinion, this is strongly believed by some as much as we know the sky is blue. So, I will begin with completing the database and then post these articles when I have time. I am sure the colour of the sky is something that is open for debate and I am up for it. However, right now, I am focusing on constructing a database of Oscar winners and nominations. I will then add other data regarding:

1. Entity Gender
2. Entity Ethnicity
3. Entity Age

I believe this information will yield some interesting observations, especially going back to the 1930s. This is something I am currently developing, but it should not take too long. It is more important to create a database with integrity than it is to do it quickly. Especially one which observes sensitive issues.
